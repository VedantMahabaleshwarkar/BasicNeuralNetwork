# BasicNeuralNetwork
A basic Neural Network that implements backpropagation with L2 regularization to recognize handwritten digits


There are various csv files for testing the network.
1) Linear Data
2) Non-linear Data
3) Digit Data

Parameters that can be tweaked to adjust the neural network
1) Number of nodes in the hidden layer
2) Epochs
